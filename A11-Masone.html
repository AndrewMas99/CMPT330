        1. What is a journey map (in your own words)!
        <br>
        Journey maps are made to visualize in big picture all parts of the system. This includes the actors, scenarios and expectations, and phases of the systems (life cycle).
        <br>
        <br>
        2. How is a journey map related to user personas and scenarios?
        <br>
        Journey maps encompass the personas, and scenarios and try to attribute them to a real application.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Why are journey maps recommended?
        <br>
        Journey maps are recommended for the building of a system. This is due to common failure points in the cycle, as many times projects are abandoned.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. What are 'friction points'?
        <br>
        Friction points are areas of problem. This is typically where a designer would attempt to mend any points of failure or frustration.
        <br>
        <br>
        5. Your honest opinion:  do you feel maps are a useful tool for a development team creating a new app?
        <br>
        I think in a corporate scenario this is all but required however for other projects potentially self projects I believe it could help but is not all neccessary.
