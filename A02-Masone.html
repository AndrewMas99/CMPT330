  <li>1. What is the 'double diamond' approach? What are the four phases and a short description of each phase?</li>
  <p>The double diamond approach is an industry standard that is used to develop systems. The 4 phases are: discover, define, develop, deliver. These are based around discovering the problem and those involved, gathering information to create a solution, developing the solution with prototypes and tests, and delivering the product as described</p>
  <br>
  <li>2. What are Dan Saffer's four approaches to interaction design - and a short description of each?  Which approach suits your software development style best? </li>
  <p>Interactive design means that their should be the ability for the user to directly alter and change the way they interact with the system. This could be through something like a menu in which the user may change some settings like a button slider or multi-option choice. The user could also be promted questions like filling in forms and gather data on information
    the user may want. Lastly the user should approach the system in a natural way like text that can be read or heard audibly. that way those with imparments could traverse.
  </p>
  <br>
  <li>3. What is "cooperative design" and how does it fit in with what you know about Agile? </li>
  <p>Cooperative design is a method that aims to include many people working on the same system. It prioritizes certain methods mainly, collaboration, flexibility, and adaptability meant to have the design and integration process happen simultaneously. </p>
  <br>
  <li>4. What are Gould & Lewis's three key principles of HCI. </li>
  <p>The principles are visibility, feedbackm abd constraints. These are guidlines meant to give user flexibility.</p>
  <br>
  <li>5. What are the four basic activities of interaction design? </li>
  <p>Research, specification, design, evaluation. These include ideas of understanding the users goals, the requirements needed, the visual and sensory attributes, and the the ensuring of user requirements and changes.</p>
  <br>
  <li>6. Look at Activity 2.5 and analyze NETFLIX for the six listed characteristics. </li>
  <p>Netflix has an interface that is easy to use and scroll through. It also offers an easy way for users to learn the interface. Netflix seems to be very efficient on the user side if you want to watch a show you scroll over and click a couple times. The memorability I believe is easy as I do not face problems although this could vary. The constraints seem slim and the affordance as well.</p>
  <br>
  <li>7. Jot down some notes so you're prepared to discuss: "Dilemma: Too much of a good thing?" </li>
  <p>The too much of a good thing dilemma implies that when too many features are implemented aimed at ensuring usability they can sometimes become exxagerated so much that it results counteractively and makes it harder to use.</p>
  <p> The questions I have are: What point does it become excessive, and can nested settings, as well as more control be hidden in ways that allow for meddling only if you know what you are doing (like certain settings Windows OS allows).
