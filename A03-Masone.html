    <td>The model was a system that allowed for a mouse and changed from terminal design. This allowed for more productive use of a computer along with a intuitive navigation option. It used a graphical interface and is a modern standard with all 3 main operating systems following that principle.</td>

    <td>The three elements are mental models, design models, and mapping. Mental models are meant to be thought out representation of the system, and is based on their memory of other systems. Design models are meant to be an model in which a programmer would use to create a system that would closely fit the user's mental model. Mapping is a process of combining both the mental model and designer model and attempts to have them combine together.</td>

    <td>A paper option allows for a tangible experience with information that is unchangable once the product has shipped. If perhaps a change occurs like on a map then something like a new road could be added. A paper option however is much more approachable and easy on any type of user while things like apps and electronic options will inherently be harder for new users. Some features for either comparasin could be live traffic reports, or something like an authors footnote. </td>
