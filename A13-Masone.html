        Q1. What is technical debt? What is UX debt?
        <br>
        Technical debt is the cost of making quick fixes to have the system pushed out sooner, while UX debt is drawbacks of not enough development happening to perfect the user experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        Q2. What is refactoring?  Why do we do it? What are the benefits?
        <br>
        Refactoring is a way of reformatting your code base. This could mean that you improve it or completely rearrange it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Q3. What is the LEanUX process?
        <br>
        It is a design that promotes many users to engage with the code that they are working on and the system. This means that experimentation can be increased at a potential cost of failure or lack of progress.
        <br>
        <br>
        Q4. What is your opinion about the to co-locate or not dilemma?
        <br>
        Co-locate has the inherent benefit of accommodating many people just 'on accident' and allows for unique design choices. This comes at a drawback however for a company as when workers like this are all spread out and unable to meet due to time conflicts or location conflicts it can give rise to problems not being fixed.
        <br>
        <br>
        Q5. What is your opinion of the slow movement? What are its negative and positive affects on design?
        <br>
        I don't care, users in systems meant to just fulfill a function have needs that are just to get the job done. With recreational hobbies it will matter, things like online shopping and marketplaces do have legitimate reason to improve however familiarity is a strong force with online tools.
        <br>
        <br>
        Q6. What is the bootstrap framework?
        <br>
        Front-end framework. This is basically a skeleton pre-built for designers that allow for a synchronous design and consistency. It can include formatting, styling, and content.
