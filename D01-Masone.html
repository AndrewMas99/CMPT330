        </li>
        <ul2>
            <li>"Don't make me think" user design in which the user can get what they want without using critical thought.
            </li>
            <li>Distractions should be reduced so the user needs to use less focus.
            </li>
        </ul2>
        <li style="font-weight: bold">Perception Principles
        </li>

            <li>Working Memory Vs Long Term Memory.
            </li>
            <li>Working Memory should have creation of gui and visual or auditory interfaces.
            </li>
            <li>Long term memory should be used to have standards set be implemented in your design. For example menu in top right and logos in top left.
            </li>
        </ul2>
        <li style="font-weight: bold">Other Principles
        </li>

            </li>
            <li>Feedback from users, and testing in the design phase.
            </li>

        </li>
        <ul2>
            <li>Elements should be visible and not have conflicting patterns and colors.
            </li>

        <li style="font-weight: bold">Consistency Principles
        </li>

        </li>

    </ul1>
    <!--Context Principles-->
    <h2>Context based Design</h2>
    <ul1>
