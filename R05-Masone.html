<h1>R05-Masone</h1>

The first example in the article mentions a room full of buttons and options, and with all the options
it was decided that there was too much confusion.
This was ultimately decided when inspectors came and realized that there was a leak
of nuclear coolant leakage. The issue with the whole operation was the control room had a usability problem.
The article goes on to mention that there was a potential for many of the "human errors" to be blamed on poor design.

The second button mentioned was in an election in which a butterfly ballot caused problems for many people.
This design problem results in many people voting for the wrong person and therefore a loss of votes for the democratic elect, and potentially a change in the election of US president.

The third button was a design flaw in a car in which the option to change gear, an option you would select going high speeds, was next to the engine off button.
This problem led to a recall of many cars and a change in the button layout. Many people had issue and stopped their car on the highway which is potentially dangerous.
This rearranges likely caused money to drain from the pockets of Lincoln and brought overall profits down from just a design problem.
