<h1>Module 8 – Chapters</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Prototypes-Low vs high fidelity, issues</strong></li>
    <p>Low fidelity prototypes are proof of concepts and are low quality versions, so they have difficulty expressing details and functionality.</p>
    <p>High fidelity prototypes usually come after and express more detail and functions, but they are more expensive and timely to create.</p>
    <li><strong>The "wizard of oz" model</strong></li>

    <p>The threshold (400 ms) that users will perceive as an instantaneous response. Fast response is important as breaks longer than a second are perceived as a delay.</p>
    <li><strong>Wireframes</strong></li>
    <p>Wireframes are visual representations of a system. These are made to signify how one event would lead to another without being bogged down by details.</p>
    <li><strong>Gamification</strong></li>

<h1>Module 9 – Chapters</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use cases: actors, goals, system</strong></li>
    <p>Use cases are ways to model interactions between users of the system.</p>
    <p>Actors are any outside force acting upon the system, this could be a user, another system, or a combined entity.</p>
    <p>Goals are objectives that the actor(s) are trying to achieve with the system.</p>
    <p>System is the software or platform that actors use to achieve their goals</p>
    <li><strong>Databases-Reality, data, metadata</strong></li>
    <p>Databases store information, Reality refers to real world entities or objets represented. Data refers to information stored within the database. Metadata is data about data, this can include information like data types.</p>
    <li><small>Four step process of database design</small></li>
    <li><strong>Database lookup tables - what & why</strong></li>
    <p>A reference table lists values and codes. The purpose is to keep the data consistent, that only valid entries are within the table, and improve maintenance and performance.</p>
    <li><small>Key database design best practices</small></li>
    <li><small>Database anomalies</small></li>
    <li><strong>Data warehouse, lake, mining</strong></li>
    <p>Data warehouse is a repository of data used for business intelligence to integrate data. Warehouses "prepackage" the data and make it easy to use.</p>
    <p>Data lakes are similar except they are made to scale easily and the data is not readily available for use.</p>
    <p>Mining is the process of studying large datasets and extracting information that matters.</p>
    <li><strong>ER diagrams</strong></li>
    <p>Entity Relationship Diagrams</p>
    <p>Entities are people place or object, Attributes are characteristics of the entity like names and ID's, and relationships are made between the entities to show correlation between the two.</p>

    <li><strong>Ethical concerns: FATE</strong></li>
    <p>Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics</p>
    <p>These principles can be exacerbated by AI and ML as systems may perpetuate existing biases or discriminate against certain groups. As designers, we are not responsible for actions. Transparency should allow for users to see how these AI models make decisions. Ethics dictate these systems should only look to improve life quality.</p>
    <li><strong>Data formatted in XML</strong></li>
    <p>e<b>X</b>tensible Markup Language, is a markup language which use elements, tags, attributes, namespaces, and structured in certain ways.</p>

  <li><strong>Functional vs non-functional attributes</strong></li>
  <p>Functional attributes are one of two types of requirements that being a requirement for the system to work.</p>
  <p>Non-Function attribute is the second and describes attributes that are not needed for the system to run and provide convenience.</p>
  <li><strong>Cloud based software</strong></li>
  <p>Software-as-a-service is when software is accessed through another system and the user goes through the system to acquire it. </p>
  <li><strong>Virtualization and Hypervisors</strong></li>
  <p>Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something, in the case of hypervisors it's a virtual version of an operating system that is run with the physical system through software.</p>
  <p>type 1 hypervisors run directly on the machine hardware, and type 2 run on top of the operating system.</p>
  <li><strong>VM's</strong></li>
  <p>Virtual Machines are software emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines use partitioned resources of the host to run.</p>
  <li><strong>Containers, Docker</strong></li>
  <p>Containers are a form of system virtualization that allow application to run in an isolated environment.</p>
  <p>Docker are tools for managing the containers and allow devs to define data storage.</p>
