<h1>Module 7 – Chapters</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Interfaces – the WIMP model</strong></li>
    <p>Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointers</p>
    <p>Windows is the rectangular box and frames, icons are the small graphical representations tat represent the file, menus are hierarchical lists of options, and pointers are mouse and trackpad interactions.</p>
    <li><small>PARC</small></li>
    <li><strong>Isomorphic icons</strong></li>
    <p>Refer to graphical symbols that are designed to have consistent visual appearences. A home icon being the main icon for the main menu is an example.</p>
    <li><small>Typography considerations</small></li>
    <li><strong>Website breadcrumb navigation</strong></li>
    <p>Breadcrumb navigation is a type of website navigation that provides users with a hierarchical trail of links that indicate the user's location within the website's structure.</p>
    <li><small>VR, AR</small></li>
    <li><small>Voice-to-text</small></li>
    <li><strong>Context-based advertising</strong></li>
    <p>Context-based advertising is a form of advertising the targets ads to a user based onthe content of the website. Targeted ads allow for more relevant advertising to a user.</p>
    <li><small>Don't Make Me Think!</small></li>
    <li><strong>How to configure pages for scanning</strong></li>
    <p>Use high-quality originals.</p>
    <p>Set the resolution appropriately.</p>
    <p>Adjust the contrast.</p>
    <p>Crop the document.</p>
    <p>Choose the appropriate file format.</p>
    <p>Preview the scanned images.</p>
    <li><strong>Three rules if you present instructions</strong></li>    <p></p>
    <p>Use simple language.</p>
    <p>Break down complex tasks into simple steps.</p>
    <p>Provide visual aids.</p>
    <li><strong>Visual hierarchies – vertical vs horizontal</strong></li>
    <p>Visual hierarchy refers to arrangement and organization of visual elements. </p>
    <li><strong>Optimizing user choices</strong></li>
    <p>Limit the number of choices the user has.</p>
    <p>Group choices into categories.</p>
    <p>Use clear and concise language.</p>
    <p>Provide guidance and feedback.</p>
    <li><small>Home pages</small></li>
    <li><strong>Navigation</strong></li>
    <p>Guide the users through the site by: keeping it simple and consistent.</p>
    <p>The site should use hierarchical rules, as well as use visual cues to guide the user.</p>
    <li><strong>Site ID's – top of page and on every page</strong></li>
    <p>Site IDs are important for branding and providing users with a consistent way to navigate back to the home page and build brand recognition.</p>
  </ul>

<h1>Module 8 – Chapters</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Prototypes-Low vs high fidelity, issues</strong></li>
    <p>Low fidelity prototypes are proof of concepts and are low quality versions, so they have difficulty expressing details and functionality.</p>
    <p>High fidelity prototypes usually come after and express more detail and functions, but they are more expensive and timely to create.</p>
    <li><strong>The "wizard of oz" model</strong></li>
    <p>Prototyping technique used in the design of interactive systems. It involves simulating the functionality without building it. It also allows for users to test the product multiple times.</p>
    <li><strong>Storyboards</strong></li>
    <p>Storyboards are visual representations of a narrative. They allow for a made up scenario and user to express the need of a system that will be built.</p>
    <li><small>Conceptional models &amp; metaphors</small></li>
    <li><strong>The Doherty Threshold</strong></li>
    <p>The threshold (400 ms) that users will perceive as an instantaneous response. Fast response is important as breaks longer than a second are perceived as a delay.</p>
    <li><strong>Wireframes</strong></li>
    <p>Wireframes are visual representations of a system. These are made to signify how one event would lead to another without being bogged down by details.</p>
    <li><strong>Gamification</strong></li>
    <p>Process of using game elements to make the user motivated to use the site. These could be tasks or fake rewards that engage the user.</p>
    <li><small>Design Thinking</small></li>
    <li><small>Arduinos and Microbits</small></li>
    <li><strong>SDK's</strong></li>
    <p>(Software Development Kit) These are tools made for others to develop applications. SDK's are intended to save developers time by providing them tools and allow for easier tools.</p>
  </ul>

<h1>Module 9 – Chapters</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use cases: actors, goals, system</strong></li>
    <p>Use cases are ways to model interactions between users of the system.</p>
    <p>Actors are any outside force acting upon the system, this could be a user, another system, or a combined entity.</p>
    <p>Goals are objectives that the actor(s) are trying to achieve with the system.</p>
    <p>System is the software or platform that actors use to acheive their goals</p>
    <li><strong>Databases-Reality, data, metadata</strong></li>
    <p>Databases store information, Reality refers to real world entities or objets represented. Data refers to information stored within the database. Metadata is data about data, this can include information like data types.</p>
    <li><small>Four step process of database design</small></li>
    <li><strong>Database lookup tables - what & why</strong></li>
    <p>A reference table lists values and codes. The purpose is to keep the data consistent, that only valid entries are within the table, and improve maintenance and performance.</p>
    <li><small>Key database design best practices</small></li>
    <li><small>Database anomalies</small></li>
    <li><strong>Data warehouse, lake, mining</strong></li>
    <p>Data warehouse is a repository of data used for business intelligence to integrate data. Warehouses "prepackage" the data and make it easy to use.</p>
    <p>Data lakes are similar except they are made to scale easily and the data is not readily available for use.</p>
    <p>Mining is the process of studying large datasets and extracting information that matters.</p>
    <li><strong>ER diagrams</strong></li>
    <p>Entity Relationship Diagrams</p>
    <p>Entities are people place or object, Attributes are characteristics of the entity like names and ID's, and relationships are made between the entities to show correlation between the two.</p>
    <li><small>Data visualization</small></li>
    <li><small>Displaying 'centrality'</small></li>
    <li><strong>Dashboards</strong></li>
    <p>Dashboards are visual representations of data, used to monitor and analyze performance indicators, metrics, and other data points.</p>
    <p>Dashboards should use Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), metrics, visualizations, filters, and alerts.</p>
    <li><small>Human-centered design</small></li>
    <li><strong>Ethical concerns: FATE</strong></li>
    <p>Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics</p>
    <p>These principles can be exacerbated by AI and ML as systems may perpetuate existing biases or discriminate against certain groups. As designers, we are not responsible for actions. Transparency should allow for users to see how these AI models make decisions. Ethics dictate these systems should only look to improve life quality.</p>
    <li><strong>Data formatted in XML</strong></li>
    <p>e<b>X</b>tensible Markup Language, is a markup language which use elements, tags, attributes, namespaces, and structured in certain ways.</p>
    <li><strong>JS data types, arrays, objects</strong></li>
    <p>JS uses things like Strings, Ints, and Booleans as data types. </p>
    <li><strong>JSON</strong></li>
    <p>JavaScript Object Notation. JSON files allow for information exchange that can be deciphered by multiple programming languages.</p>
